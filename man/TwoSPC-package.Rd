\title{A  Package  for  the  Analysis  of  Time  to  Event  OutcomesSubject  to    Right-Censoring  Using  ROC  Curves  in  Two-Arm  Randomized  Trials.}
\description{
Survival data is often used in clinical trials to determine effectiveness of a new treatment.
Analysis of such data is usually completed using two separate Kaplan-Meier curves, a Log Rank Test and Cox Proportional Hazard models.
We propose an alternative way to analyze this type of data by combining the two Kaplan-Meier curves into an ROC curve and using the area under the curve (AUC) as measure of treatment effectiveness.
